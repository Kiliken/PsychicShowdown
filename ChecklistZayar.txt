SPECIAL OBJECTS:
These are special objects with a lower spawn rate and/or spawn at a set time interval.

@ Skull (small):
- Once thrown, chases the other player and deal damage (cannot detect obstacles or large objects and will collide with them).
- Once thrown, lights on fire like ghost rider and starts laughing.

@ Spear (small):
- Once thrown, multiplies itself into 5-10 copies.

 @Meteor (small):
- Initially a small rock. Once thrown, it starts growing bigger and bigger until it hits something.
- The damage it deals to the opponent will vary to the size it is at when it hits the enemy.

@ Pudding/Flan (large):
- When jumped on, makes the player jump up very high, giving them a high vantage point.






UNSURE:
- Disable hitbox after collision? (yes for now)
- change jump condition to fall velocity speed?
- make player temporarily invincible (disable hurtbox) after taking a hit?


BUGS:
- map too high near spawn point and player goes through it
@ object position is not updated when throwing
@ objects going through walls when you throw them (make large objects kinematic)
@ when you aim high, the object already collides with the ground
- When dashing on uneven surfaces, the player will temporarily clip into the ground
@ jumps aren't recharged when touching uneven surfaces


NOTES:
- movement speeds, etc will probably need adjustments
- highlight items red, turns to green when grabbable
- items shoot in a straight line
- When items are grabbed, they will move to your position
