Before school festival:
- Since we only have 2 weeks, there will be no big changes
- We will focus on making the game more visually appealing
@ player model will be added
@ some object models will be added
- some sound effects will be added
- parts of the game where the programming adjustments are needed will be done


UNSURE:
- Disable hitbox after collision? (yes for now)
- change jump condition to fall velocity speed?
- make player temporarily invincible (disable hurtbox) after taking a hit?


BUGS:
@ object position is not updated when throwing
@ objects going through walls when you throw them (make large objects kinematic)
@ when you aim high, the object already collides with the ground
- When dashing on uneven surfaces, the player will temporarily clip into the ground
@ jumps aren't recharged when touching uneven surfaces


NOTES:
- movement speeds, etc will probably need adjustments
- highlight items red, turns to green when grabbable
- items shoot in a straight line
- When items are grabbed, they will move to your position
